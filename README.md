# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

To run this program, you need to have **Node.js** installed.

Then, you need to go in the root directory of this project. (The root directory is called `System_administration_dist_system`.)

You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
cd
```

with the name of the root directory at the end.

Then, you can run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

and

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and open the browser with the URL `http://localhost:5173`.
